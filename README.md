## 📌 Project Summary

This Power BI project analyzes clinical and operational data from five hospitals, covering 1,000 patients. The goal is to generate actionable insights around **treatment effectiveness**, **cost efficiency**, and **recovery outcomes**. It supports healthcare leaders in data-driven decision-making for **resource optimization**, **cost reduction**, and **patient-centered care**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI**: For building interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
- **Data Analysis & Modeling**: Cleaning, filtering, and deriving insights from patient and hospital datasets.
- **Statistical Reasoning**: Applied to interpret recovery patterns and treatment costs.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Practical healthcare understanding applied to analytics for better insights.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Two Excel sheets were used, containing detailed information on:

### 1. Patient Information  
- Patient ID, Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type  
- Diagnosis, Treatment, Admission & Discharge Dates  
- Total Bill, Full Prescription Details  

### 2. Hospital & Staff Information  
- Hospital Name, Doctor Name, Room Number  
- Daily Cost, Treatment Administered  
- Recovery Rating  

---

## ❓ Business Question

> **How can the hospital optimize treatment costs while maintaining or improving recovery outcomes across age groups and treatment types?**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **💰 Surgery has the highest cost per patient**, but not necessarily the best outcomes.
2. **👍 Counseling and medication show high recovery ratings at a lower cost**, making them more efficient for certain conditions.
3. **👴 Senior patients show wide variability in recovery ratings**, emphasizing the need for age-tailored treatment protocols.
4. **📈 Admissions peak during certain months**, correlated with diagnosis trends – useful for staffing and inventory planning.

---

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

### 🔺 High Priority
- **Shift toward cost-effective treatments** (e.g., counseling, physical therapy) where recovery outcomes are strong.
- **Customize care protocols for seniors** to reduce variability in outcomes.

### 🔹 Medium Priority
- Use **admission trend analysis** to adjust staffing and resource allocation ahead of peak demand periods.

### 🔻 Low Priority
- Pilot **alternatives to surgery** for non-critical cases to reduce costs without sacrificing care quality.
